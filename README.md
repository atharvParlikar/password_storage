# password_storage
This is a password storage like Dashlane which stores your passwords in your system in a json file in which the passwords are encrypted in AES encryption and the key for the encryption is generated using SHA-256 one way encryption.

You need only one external library and it is in requirements.txt, so you can do "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal or command prompt.
NOTE: This project is only tested on Windows 10.
